    description:
      "Insomnia can be defined as the inability to fall asleep at night. Most cases of insomnia can be transient and usually pass without the need for medical treatment but in some cases the problem can become chronic, which can cause a negative impact on life during waking hours. A person may be regarded as suffering from chronic insomnia if experiencing sleep problems 3 times per week or more and for 3 months or longer and to resolve this issue, many people rely on sleeping tablets to get to sleep at night.",

    description:
      "There are a number of sleeping problems that may be defined as insomnia. These include problems falling asleep at night, waking up frequently throughout the night, or waking too early in the morning. These types of sleeping problems often leave sufferers feeling tired throughout the following day, resulting in under performance at work, lethargy and a general lack of drive and concentration.",

    title: "Causes of Insomnia",
    description:
      "There are a number of factors that may cause insomnia. Often, medical conditions can trigger periods of sleeplessness. These may include back pain, arthritis, gastrointestinal problems and sleep apnoea. Some medications are also known to cause sleep problems including medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, nasal allergies and depression. Psychological factors can also be a major cause of sleeping disorders. Conditions such as anxiety, stress and depression often make it hard to fall asleep at night and many people resort to using sleeping tablets to get a good night's sleep. Sometimes, a recent traumatic experience or worrying about financial matters or relationship problems can make it difficult to fall asleep at night. In fact, around half of all cases of insomnia arise as a result of psychological stress.",

      "The bedroom should only be used for sleep and sex. Taking part in other activities such as working, reading or watching television should be avoided. The aim is to make the mind associate the bedroom with sleep only and not activities that promote thought and emotion as this will only hinder attempts to fall asleep quickly.",
      "Relax when trying to fall asleep. Looking at the clock constantly or worrying about work or events taking place the following day will only increase anxiety levels. This will lead to increases in adrenalin levels, resulting in sleeplessness.",
      "Follow a regular routine when it comes to sleeping and waking times. The body is more easily able to fall asleep when a routine is followed - even at weekends if possible.",

In such situations, sleeping pills can be a fast, effective way to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the duration of the night. Although sleeping pills can provide fast results, they should not be regarded as a long term solution. In most cases, they are effective in breaking the cycle of chronic insomnia and their use can be gradually reduced over a number of weeks until they are no longer required.",

It should also be established that the website selling the sleeping tablets is a reputable one. All sleeping tablets available for sale should be licensed medications that have been deemed safe and effective for the treatment of insomnia problems.",
